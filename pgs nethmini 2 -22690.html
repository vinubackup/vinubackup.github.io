    <div id="box"><h1>Pure Energy Empowerment in Sri Lanka</h1></div>
    <div id="main-box">
    <hr color="blue" id="hr-one">

    <div class="box-one">
        It is imperative for Sri Lanka to secure its energy supply by focusing on
         renewable energy investments as Sri Lanka is a country that is constantly at risk of 
         climate change. In addition to environmental impacts, climate change will also affect tourism,
          agriculture, society and health in the country.  And energy have become key indicators.</div>

          <div class="box-one"> As a developing country, Sri Lanka's demand for electricity will increase.
 This is the main problem today.  Although the country has a lot of renewable energy potential, 
 it should be used sparingly.  The transition to renewable materials provides an opportunity to reduce 
 fuel imports that burden government finances, create jobs, including for women, and rebuild a clean and 
 sustainable energy-based economy.  This transition will lead to multiple achievements for the economy,
  the energy industry and the environment.</div>

        <h2>Activation of Energy migration</h2>
        <div class="box-two">
             Health and economic impacts with the COVID-19 epidemic are a clear priority.  
             At the same time, with the recovery from the epidemic, governments had to re-establish their 
             immediate, medium and long-term goals for clean energy and formulate projects for new policies.
               A broader policy and action framework is essential for the renewable and energy efficiency 
               movement to attract public as well as private sector participation.  Eliminating regulatory 
               uncertainties, improving network capacity to allow for more renewable energy and facilitating 
               land acquisition are among the measures that will boost the confidence of private investors. 
                An Energy Energy Strategy can overcome these difficulties by increasing the potential for
                 renewable energy development to achieve economic, sectoral, environmental and social benefits 
                 to Sri Lanka through greater co-ordination efforts and greater cooperation between both the public and private sectors. </div>
        
        <div class="box-two">
            The Asian Development Bank (ADB), Sri Lanka's largest multilateral development partner in the energy sector, 
            fully supports the transformation.  The Bank continues to focus on,
            <ul>
          <li>  increasing renewable energy use</li>
           <li>improving energy efficiency</li>
           <li> expanding the transmission and distribution system to absorb more 
            renewable energy</li> 
            <li>improving the reliability and quality of energy supply.</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Some recent interventions include the 30.5 MW Moragolla Hydroelectric Power Plant and
                 related infrastructure;  Systematic development of the 100 MW Mannar Wind Power
                  Generation Project;  Credit facility to install a solar roof capacity of about 60 MW;  
                  And Siyambalanduwa, Poonaryn and Mannar Phase 2 Development of future regenerative parks.
                    These allow for clean energy development in addition to many ADB projects in the past.</b>
                    <br>
           
           <b>In order to reduce the risk of climate change, Sri Lanka must transition to clean energy and develop a more 
               sustainable and resilient future.</b>

                <h2>Sustainable Development</h2>
                <div class="box-two"><b>
                     Investment decisions on renewable energy need to be justified beyond the economic 
                     benefits. Environmental and social well-being should be taken into consideration
                      while infrastructure development should be given priority.  The transition to clean 
                      energy is expected to help Sri Lanka achieve affordable electricity, enhance energy 
                      security and achieve strategic priorities in fulfilling the nationally determined
                       contribution commitments under the Paris Agreement on the Environment and

<h2>A Green Economic Future</h2>
<div class="box-two"><b>
    The country's growing dependence on fossil fuel imports is due to rising energy demand and slow 
    progress on renewable energy projects.  This situation is exacerbated by the impact of climate
     change on hydropower generation and has become more precarious. 
      Thermal power (Petroleum and Coal) accounts for about 54% of Sri Lanka's primary energy supply
       in 2017.  As a result of the increasing share of fossil fuels in the generation mix, higher
        generation costs are added to the country's fiscal year with end-user tariffs. 
         The country's energy mix is ​​diversifying, reducing its dependence on fossil fuel imports due
          to the transition to renewable materials.  Facing the COVID-19 crisis effectively and 
          positively is an opportunity to restructure the economy through cleaner and more sustainable 
          investment that enhances economic productivity and contributes to local job creation.</b>
          </div>
          <div class="box-two"> <b>The bulk of oil-fired heat generation is costly electricity and poses a threat to the country's
             energy security.  Diversification by switching to wind, solar and other renewable sources can
              reduce the security threat.  Meanwhile, the decline in renewable energy and storage technologies 
              presents opportunities for Sri Lanka to leapfrog from renewable energy
             investments and take advantage of competitive clean energy technology.</b></div>
