    <h2>Why don't we use more renewable energy?</h2>
    <p><b>
        With regard to renewable energy sources, it is a widely held opinion that they are in many ways better for the 
        environment than non-renewable, fossil fuel sources.  They do not require the same level of extraction as fossil fuels, 
        but if some of them are considered "pure," it means that they have no effect on 
        the earth in converting them into electricity.</b>
        <p style=" color:blue;"><b> "In each case, they have seized it, despite obstacles we can scarcely imagine."</p>
        </P>
        <p><b> The transition to renewable energy not only means that a group of people will choose a new way to empower their homes,
             but that entire companies will need to re-evaluate how they make their money and where they get their energy from.
               Millions of homes, schools, businesses, public buildings and transportation hubs will need to be set up - 
               this will not happen overnight.
        </b></p>
        <p><b> Currently, renewable energy sources account for about 8% of U.S. energy consumption and about 14% of global energy needs.  
            This is primarily due to the fact that technology has taken time to develop to produce large quantities of clean energy,
             and many of our engines and systems have been developed to be fossil fuel-free.</b></p>
             <h2 style="color:red;">Why do we make better use of solar Energy?</h2>

             <p><b>Solar power may be healthier for the planet, but that doesn't mean it is entirely reliable. 
                 While that can sound crazy  the sun shines in some form every day, right?  it's because the solar panels we have can 
                 only generate electricity when it's a clear sunny day.</b></p>

<p><b>In order for a home or business to rely entirely on solar power, the owners would need to live in a sunny area and use batteries
     to store excess energy for cloudy and rainy days. While technology is advancing quickly and some scientists are having success
      with panels that can generate energy even on overcast days, this obviously is not sustainable enough yet to fuel a nation.</b></p>

<p><b>Installing solar panels on our homes  and anywhere else  is also a costly exercise, and so while we will likely
     see more new buildings go up with solar panels on their roofs, it will be a while before there are enough to contribute 
     significantly to the power grid.</b>
     <p><b>What we can do in the meantime, though, is take a closer look at our individual efforts. Companies such as Inspire 
         are committed to creating a world powered by renewable energy and making the switch as easy as possible. Learn more about
          Inspire and how we're a renewable energy company dedicated to providing
          clean energy in homes.</b></p>

<h2 style="color:rgb(180, 40, 117);" >Where Do most forms of Renewable energy come from?</h2>
<p><b>Renewable energy sources are typically derived from natural resources that will not deplete over time. They offer a more 
    sustainable option, but are newer and typically more expensive to install than fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and oil. 
    Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and tidal energy come from the wind, the sun, and the sea, respectively.</b></p>

   <p><b> Other less-green renewable sources are also used, such as biomass fuel. This is made by farming by-products and natural
     materials that we throw away. While burning these still creates harmful gases, sourcing them is easy and there will always
      be more of it.</b></p>
      <h2 style="color:rgb(180, 96, 40);" >What are the advantages of using renewable energy more often? </h2>
      <p><b>
        While difficult to generate in our homes on our own, especially if living in an urban area, renewable energy has a huge number advantages for all of us:
        Protects the environment: Using energy from sources like wind, solar, and geothermal helps to reduce the amount of CO₂ released into the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming.
        <ul>
       <li> - Protects our health: Not only is it better for the environment, but it is also beneficial to our health.
            With fewer gases being released, we are at lower risk of developing pollution-based respiratory problems such as asthma.</li>
      <li>  - Reduces water waste: Renewable energy sources prevent a huge amount of water waste every year and are far less threatening
           to areas of the world that are prone to flooding and droughts.</li>
      <li> - Creates jobs: Energy sources like solar power and wind energy are significant job creators. Wind turbine technicians are the
           fastest growing job in the US and solar photovoltaic installers are currently in third place. This will only grow as we turn more
            to renewable energy sources to slow environmental damage and find alternatives to dwindling fossil fuels.</li>
      <li>- Fossil fuels are running out: Experts forecast we may only have 50-150 years of fossil fuels left to use,
           so we need to find alternatives soon and use them to power our daily lives before there are shortages.</li>
        </ul>
        There are also other contributions we can make individually. Learn about the benefits of renewable energy and how you can make
         the switch with Inspire.</b></p>
         <h2 style="color:rgb(145, 26, 139);" >What are the disadvantages of using renewable energy more often?</h2>

         <p><b> 
              <ul>
           <li> - It can be costly: As with any technology that has already been established for some time, fossil fuels are
                much cheaper to fund. When adding up the cost of installing solar panels, for example, one must take into account the cost 
                of purchasing each piece of equipment, transporting it to the site, and maintaining it once it has been installed. 
                Some countries' governments are currently offering subsidies to incentivize people to invest in renewable energy,
                 but sadly this is not yet the case worldwide.</li>
          <li> - It still causes pollution indirectly: The equipment and parts required to construct wind turbines or solar panels
               often have to be shipped across the country, or even the world. This use of long-distance transportation is certainly a 
               culprit for more pollution, though far less when compared to the long-term impact caused by extracting fossil fuels.</li>
         <li>   - Some geographic limitations: Wind energy can only be harnessed in areas that get a lot of wind. Wind farms are most often 
             seen on the tops of hills or offshore, but consistently high-speed winds can't be guaranteed, even in these areas. Hydroelectric 
             dams and wave turbines can only be built in specific areas, and current solar panels can only harness energy when placed in strong 
             direct sunlight.</li>
          <li> - Biomass is still harmful: Biomass requires a significant amount of vegetation waste in order to be viable, 
              rendering it nearly impossible to generate energy from in dry countries with large desert areas. Burning our trash to 
              generate energy obviously helps reduce landfill waste, but still releases harmful gases.
           <li>- It's not easy to store renewable energy: Fossil fuels are harmful to the environment and will eventually run out, but 
               they can cater to the demand for a consistent energy supply. Fossil fuels can also be stored to generate electricity at a
                later date, whereas renewable energy sources require large batteries to save any additional electricity they produce.</li>
            
           <li>- Requires space: Renewable energy requires the use of significant amounts of land. Wind turbines must be spaced out evenly
                across farms, which means they cannot be tucked into small spaces. The same goes for solar plants; they take up far more space
                 than traditional power plants and are not as efficient.</li>
           <li> - People don't know much about renewable sources: There is a lack of education surrounding sustainable energy.
                As with all new technological advancements, renewable energy is not as commonly used as fossil fuels simply because people don't 
                know about it. People are much less likely to use green energy sources in their own homes if they don't even know hey exist, or
                 that they can choose to harness them. This lack of education is becoming less of a problem as we learn more about ways to protect
                  the environment. Still, most people aren't aware of the difference that could be made if everyone switched to utility companies 
                  that supplied clean energy.</li></ul>

                  <h2 style="color:rgb(76, 0, 255);" > Is it possible to use renewable energy and resources more often?</h2>

                    When it comes to renewable energy sources, it is becoming more widely known that they are far better for the environment in
                     many way than their non-renewable, fossil fuel counterparts. They don't require the same level of extraction as fossil fuels,
                     if at all, and some are considered “clean,” which essentially means they have little to no impact on the planet when being
                      converted into electricity.
                    
                    If clean energy is so beneficial, why haven't we all made the switch to renewable energy sources? Why don't
                     we use more renewable energy? Let's find out.

                  <p><b>
                    As far as individual countries are concerned, making the switch from one energy source to another will undoubtedly take some time
                     as new power plants and infrastructure are introduced.
